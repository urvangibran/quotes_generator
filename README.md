# Quotes Generator
Hai, i just want to share my small javascript project. (1)

## About
For this project, i use quotable API that you can check [here](https://docs.quotable.io/docs/api/ZG9jOjQ2NDA2-introduction) <br />
It is not too hard, you just need to know about javascript DOM, how to fetch data from API, and other basic Javascript
